Sure, here's a high-level pseudocode and project outline for your link-parser RemNote plugin:
High-Level Pseudocode:

    Listen for text selection events in the RemNote document.
    When a text selection event is triggered, extract the selected text and check if it is a valid URL.
    If the selected text is a valid URL, use the window.open method to open the URL in the user's default browser.
    If the selected text is not a valid URL, create a new Rem in RemNote with the selected text as the content.

Project Outline:

    Install and set up the @remnote/plugin-sdk by following the instructions in the RemNote plugin documentation.
    Create a new plugin project called "link-parser" and configure the project settings, including the plugin name and description.
    Use the RemNote SDK to register an event listener for text selection events in the RemNote document.
    When a text selection event is triggered, use regular expressions to check if the selected text is a valid URL.
    If the selected text is a valid URL, use the window.open method to open the URL in the user's default browser.
    If the selected text is not a valid URL, use the RemNote SDK to create a new Rem in RemNote with the selected text as the content.
    Create a user interface for the plugin that allows users to enable or disable the link-parser functionality and view any previously parsed links or created Rems.
    Test the plugin thoroughly and make any necessary modifications or improvements.
    Publish the plugin to the RemNote plugin marketplace, following the guidelines and requirements outlined in the RemNote plugin documentation.

Note that this is just a high-level pseudocode and project outline, and you may need to modify or expand upon these steps depending on your specific needs and the requirements of the RemNote plugin SDK. Additionally, be sure to review the RemNote plugin documentation and guidelines carefully to ensure that your plugin meets the necessary standards and requirements for publication.
